=Notepad=

***This project depends on the Android Support v4 Library and LicensesDialog (http://psdev.de)!***
They are not included but you should be able to add them.

I would really like some help with this, I have some issues with it like the license dialog which I just added. 
Could someone show me how to launch it from a PreferenceScreen? 
I also need to get rid of all the stupid deprecations. Stupid Lint! Get stuck in my dryer! :
I literally had to change all the cursor.close(); to cursor=null; because it
crashes the app when you return to it in the recents.

I would also like to use Fragments (yuck) to prepare for a 2-column view, but 
it is really hard trying to migrate to it. Why did they have to make it soo 
difficult?!


---- 
There are two NoteList screens. One is for the light theme and one is for the dark theme. It just uses different icons. That is 100% planned.

The Startup activity loads the preference for the theme and launches the right NoteList for that theme. It also mostly eliminates theme switching!

It also instantly loads the theme without restarting the app. When the NoteList launches Preferences, it declares finish(); and when the Back key
is pressed in the preferences, Startup is launched and that launches the right activity.

My KitKat theme is in styles.xml. The light theme starts on Holo Light and adds selector and button colors. The Dark theme is a bit more complex, 
using the same elements as above, but the Action Bar is borrowed from Theme.Holo.Light.DarkActionBar and the background is regular Holo.

================ Notice ===================
I give all of my credit to BanderLabs for making the Notepad tutorial app 1000 times better! It is 80% of the same code.

The major things I did: 
	- Switch between KitKat Holo, ICS/JB Holo, "DeviceDefault" to satisfy TouchWiz fans, and classic Gingerbread (but why? This is Holo themed...). Choose a light or dark version.
	- LicensesDialog
	- Option for Monospace font
	- Option to toggle AutoCorrect
	- Converted small activities to Dialogs. NOTE: I need to have actual dialog buttons, not actual buttons.
	- Organized PreferenceScreen
	- Action Bar
	- Renamed weird strings.
	- New icon (not mine, unzipped from closed Ice Cream Sandwich theme (can't remember the link) Over the summer I will design one.
	- Organized/optimized some activities, like reordering the buttons, to comply with ICS.
	- PreferenceFragment!!!!
	
================= To do ===============

	- Rename package to com.devin.notepad so it would not cause conflicts
	- Better Action Bar usage.
	- HDPI, XHDPI and XXHDPI
	- Tablet-friendly. "Honeypad" demo seems good, but hard to implement, because of Fragments.
	- Remove deprecated stuff, esp. Cursor and other stuff.
	- Fragments, but from the look of it, it will require a whole rewrite.
	- Better About dialog.
	- Dialog messages should have positive/negative buttons, not using layout buttons.
	- Remove buttons on NoteEdit. It ahouldn't be that hard to put it in the AB.
	- When Back is pressed from the editor, ask for a confirm dialog instead of auto-save.
	- GB support using ABC, ABS, or HoloEverywhere.
	- Java or XML based ActionBar? 
	- Check box theme is weird. 
	- Easter egg? ;)

======Requested in comments on BanderLabs' Wiki======

	- Save path - Use FileMan?
	- Smarter import/export. 
	- dpl0...@gmail.com - Encryption of backups?... How? Password-protected ZIP?
	- dpl0...@gmail.com - auto backup
	- cagilber...@gmail.com - Timestamps
	- polkadot...@gmail.com - Lock/hide
	- b...@xpressionmedia.com - Import CSV
	- Desktop sync.... with what? Wouldn't that make the
	  app bloated?!
